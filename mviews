A. All materialized views accessible to the current user

select owner as schema_name,
       mview_name,
       container_name,
       query as definition,
       refresh_mode,
       refresh_method,
       build_mode,
       last_refresh_date,
       compile_state
from sys.all_mviews
order by owner, mview_name;

B. If you have privilege on dba_mviews

select owner as schema_name,
       mview_name,
       container_name,
       query as definition,
       refresh_mode,
       refresh_method,
       build_mode,
       last_refresh_date,
       compile_state
from sys.dba_mviews
order by owner, mview_name;



The following query can be used to know when the MV was last refreshed.

SQL> alter session set nls_date_format='dd/mm/yy hh24:mi:ss';
SQL> select owner, mview_name, last_refresh_type, last_refresh_date
    from all_mviews;



select currmvowner, currmvname from v$mvrefresh;
